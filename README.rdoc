== DESCRIPTION:

Calculate the time of sunrise and sunset for location on a specific date.

== SYNOPSIS:

Create a new SunTime instance with a Date and latitude and longitude in decimal format as arguments. Then you can call the `sunrise` and `sunset` methods on that instance.

    require 'sun_time'
    
    date = Date.new(2009, 7, 23)
    latitude = 57.7119                  # N 57° 42' 42"
    longitude = 11.9683                 # E 11° 58' 5"
    
    sun_time = SunTime.new(date, latitude, longitude)
    
    sun_time.sunrise
    # => Thu Jul 23 02:50:32 UTC 2009
    
    sun_time.sunset
    # => Thu Jul 23 19:48:56 UTC 2009
    
Note that the times returned are always in UTC, so you have to convert them to your local time yourself if you want that.

If you try to calculate sunrise or sunset for a location where the sun doesn't rise or set on the chosen date, nil is returned:

    winter_in_sweden = SunTime.new(Date.new(2009,12,22), 67.8529, 20.2426)

    winter_in_sweden.sunrise
    # => nil

    winter_in_sweden.sunset
    # => nil

    summer_in_sweden = SunTime.new(Date.new(2009,6,22), 67.8529, 20.2426)

    summer_in_sweden.sunrise
    # => nil

    summer_in_sweden.sunset
    # => nil


=== Date Extension:

Optionally, you can use SunTime as an extension to the Date class. Here's how you do that:

    require 'sun_time'
    require 'sun_time/date_ext

    date = Date.new(2009, 7, 23)

    date.sunrise(57.7119, 11.9683)
    # => Thu Jul 23 02:50:32 UTC 2009

    date.sunset(57.7119, 11.9683)
    # => Thu Jul 23 19:48:56 UTC 2009
